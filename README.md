# SimpleDataCatalog

**Simple Data Catalog (SDC)** is a solution for keeping track of your data in a simple non-sophisticated way. 
While other Data Catalog solutions are more feature-rich, they require way more complexity in the setup.

## Current version
0.0, everything WIP

## Database Support
### Backend
Tested on latest versions available as Docker containers for PostgreSQL. 
During development SQLite is used, which is also an option for simplified deployments.

### Sources
Theoretically every RDBMS that is [supported by sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/).

## Credits

Please support those projects, because of them we can develop such things as Simple Data Catalog.
